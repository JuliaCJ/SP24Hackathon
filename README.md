# Close Care - Team A31

Welcome to Team A31's Hackathon Solution! 

Our pitch is Close Care, an app dedicated to helping people in need. 

Close care is dedicated to our 3 personas, Joe, Mary, and Tom.

Joe is a homeless, disabled, veteren. Mary is a single mother with food insecurity who struggles with addiction. Tom is a volunteer at a local shelter who wants to help as many people as possible, but can't afford to advertise. Close Care offers solutions to all their problems!

All of our solution information can be found within this GitHub Repository.

[Hackathon-SP2024](Hackathon-SP2024) contains all of the code for our MVP.

[CloseCarePresentation](CloseCarePresentation) is the presentation that went along with our demo.

[AppMockUP](AppMockUp) contains a mock up of what we would like our app to look like in the future. 

Thank you to Assurant for sponsoring us! We hope you enjoy our solution to this challenge.
